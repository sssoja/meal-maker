<h1>Meal Maker</h1>
<p>As a frequent diner, you love trying out new restaurants and experimenting with different foods. However, having to figure out what you want to order can be a time-consuming ordeal if the menu is big, and you want an easier way to be able to figure out what you are going to eat.</p>

<p>In this project, you’ll use JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu. We’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!</p>

Taken from [Codeacademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/bwa-javascript-iterators-objects-and-classes/modules/learn-javascript-objects/projects/meal-maker) tutorial on JavaScript, Iterators and Objects.
